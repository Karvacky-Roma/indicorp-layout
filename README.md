## Installation On Windows

1. Downloading [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Open powershell on behalf of the administrator and enter `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` so that in the future there will be no errors associated with the lack of certain rights
3. Run the command `npm install gulp-cli -g` in the console. This command installs Gulp globally, that is, you can run it from any folder on your computer.

## Installation On MacOS

1. Before installing, make sure that on device is installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. After that, in the terminal, write this command `sudo npm install gulp-cli -g`

## Get Started

``git clone https://github.com/Karvacky-Roma/Gulp-start-template.git``

After cloning, open a terminal at the folder address, to install all the necessary modules, write the command ``npm i``(it can take some time).

To start build write the command ``gulp``

## File And Folder System

    %project_folder%
    ├── #src
    |   ├── fonts
    |   ├── img
    |   ├── js
    |   |    ├── main.js
    |   |    └── slick.min.js
    |   ├── scss
    |   |    ├── _fonts.scss
    |   |    ├── _footer.scss
    |   |    ├── _header.scss
    |   |    ├── _mixins.scss
    |   |    ├── _nullstyle.scss
    |   |    ├── _slick.scss
    |   |    ├── _ui.scss
    |   |    └── style.scss
    |   _footer.html
    |   _header.html
    |   index.html
    |
    └── %source_folder%
		├── fonts
		├── img
		├── css
		|    ├── style.css
		|    └── style.min.css
		├── js
		|    ├── main.js
		|    └── main.min.js
		└── index.html

At the root there are two folders: the source folder and the folder that is obtained as a result of the build. In the source folder, we also observe the folder of fonts, images, scripts and scss files. The source folder contains the compiled style and script files, and a compressed duplicate of the file is also created.
